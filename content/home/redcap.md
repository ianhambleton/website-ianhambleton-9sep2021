Using REDCap, you can remove identifiers from a dataset prior to exporting for analysis to create either a [limited data set](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/limited_dataset) or a [safe-harbor data set](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html). A safe harbor data set is the removal of the 18 pieces of information considered identifiers for the purposes of HIPAA compliance. 

## How is REDCap supported?

## Introduction
This free web-book is simply called **Research Data Handling**. We have developed the guide as a resource for understanding many of the important concepts around managing the data you or others collect as part of the research process. Although our guide is developed with post-graduate students, early career researchers, and information professionals in mind, many of the chapter sections can be used as standalone guidelines on a specific aspect of data handling. If you are a more experienced researcher, you can dip into specific book sections to explore the state-of-play in a particular area of data handling (such as for example data security, data confidentiality, data legislation, or data sharing). 

Our research work is based in the Caribbean and in the many Small Island Developing States, and where possible the examples and case-studies we use are  relevant to these settings. But the concepts we describe are generic - relevant to anyone working with research data. We have made this guide freely available on the web for anyone to explore at their own pace.

## Goals of the Guide
We have designed this guide to help researchers manage their research data. The guide can be used in a few ways:

- As a self-paced learning tool - reading the chapters in sequence, and following the associated exercises.
- As a set of standalone guidelines, with each guideline describing an aspect of current best-practice data-handling.  
- As a practical _"How To"_  guide for managing research data through the lifecycle of a research project. Practical tools are provided with each section to help researchers manage their project data. <mark>A listing of these tools is available here.</mark>
- As a companion guide to our <mark>instructor-led courses.</mark>
  
An ultimate goal of the guide and associated training is to help you to make your research data resources Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). You can read more about the FAIR data principles [here]({{< relref "../0-researchdataincontext/0-110-fair/" >}}).

## Structure of the Guide
### Our guide follows the Research Data Lifecycle
The guide follows the **seven** stages of the Research Data Lifecycle (DLc). [You can read more about the DLc here]({{< relref "../0-researchdataincontext/0-100-thedatalifecycle/" >}}). The contents of the seven data lifestyle chapters in this guide are summarised in the [table later in this section](#guide-contents-by-chapter).

### Useful tips
Useful tips, mostly drawing on practical experience with data handling, are presented in green boxes
{{< notice tip >}}
If you are planning data handling for a randomized controlled trial, you should follow the **CONSORT checklist**.

### Our materials for download
Throughout the guide, materials for download that can help you with your research data handling are highlighted in an orange box. These boxes will generally be at the start of each section. <mark>A full set of materials are available for download on the Resources page</mark>

### External resources
When useful information or resources are available from an external website, we present a link to those resources in a blue box. These links will open in a new tab.
{{< notice note >}}
The **LEARN Project** has created resources to help Research Performing Institutions manage their research data. Using the LERU Roadmap for Research Data as a starting point, LEARN has produced many freely-accessible materials. You can access those materials <a href="http://learn-rdm.eu/en/about/" target="_blank">here</a>

## Using the Guide for Training 
Our guide is part book and part training course. At the start of each page we list the practical resources relevant to the page, and the training materials available for download. For those of you that prefer an instructor-led learning environment, or who require a certificate of completion, we offer two courses. <mark>You can view our training schedule here.</mark>

{{< notice info >}}
**COURSE 1: Taught Module**</br> We offer a taught course that broadly follows the materials covered in this guide. The taught course comes in two formats. In Semester 1 we offer a full-time 1-week course. In Semester 2 the same material is presented over 10-weeks. Both courses involve 26 contact hours, or 2-credits.
{{< /notice >}}

{{< notice info >}}
**COURSE 2: Discussion Groups**</br> We also offer the opportunity of working through the guide in a self-study discussion group, led by an experienced data-handling facilitator. 
{{< /notice >}}

You can think of the guide as a self-paced learning resource, and the associated courses as more formal, and more interactive, online training opportunities. This guide is the companion text to our online courses.

If you follow our guide from start to finish, you will travel through the research data lifecycle from planning, collecting, and processing data, to analysing, preserving, sharing and (ultimately) re-using data resources. The entire guide can be covered in around 5 half-day sessions, but it has a modular design, and you can hop on and off at any time.

We have drawn extensively from a number of international data-handling sources. <mark>Those sources are listed here.</mark> Just as important, we have been working with research data for our entire (and now pretty long!) research careers. We have drawn on this experience to bring you a guide that reflects much of the current best-practice among research data handlers worldwide.

There are great examples of best-practice data-handling across the Caribbean, and as much as possible, we draw on Caribbean examples throughout the guide.

## How to use this guide
How we all handle research data has changed dramatically in recent years. This guide is updated regularly to reflect advances in the field, and most researchers should find something of interest in the guide. Researchers at different stages of their careers, and from different disciplines, may choose to focus on specific aspects of the guide. Below we suggest how different researchers might most benefit from the content of the guide.

The guide introduces each subject area, discusses why it is important, then focusses on **how to** enact each stage of data handling within the context of a research study. The emphasis at all times is on how to get your work done, using best-practice data-handling.

Depending on the stage of career you have reached, you might use the guide in different ways:

<i>As a mid-career researcher, you are likely to have some experience in handling research data. The guide can be used to ensure you are following best-practice data-handling at all stages of the Research Data Lifecycle. You will read more about the Research Data Lifecycle in the next chapter (Research Data in Context). Some areas of Data Handling are changing fast, and you may return to these sections regularly to keep abreast of the latest developments. Examples of fast-changing areas of data handling are:

- Ethical Issues in Data Handling
- International and Regional Data Regulations
- Ensuring Data Security and Data Confidentiality
- Processes for encouraging FAIR data
- Data Sharing methodologies 

These areas and more are covered in this online guide. Each data-handling area is also available as a <mark>standalone downloable document</mark>.

## Student
For example, they can be divided by source or by physical format. The sources of data can, for example, be registers (e.g. administrative, historical, voting results, medical, etc.), existing research data, population group(s) and communications. Physical formats of data include numerical, textual, still image, geospatial, audio, video and software. Regardless of the source and physical format of the data, data is often defined by as how they are created/captured. Examples of this includes electronic text documents, spreadsheets, laboratory notebooks, field notebooks and diaries, questionnaires, transcripts and codebooks, audiotapes and videotapes, photographs and films, examination results, specimens, samples, artefacts, slides, database schemas, database contents, models, algorithms and scripts, workflows, standard operating procedures and protocols, experimental results, metadata and other data files like e.g. literature review records and email archives.

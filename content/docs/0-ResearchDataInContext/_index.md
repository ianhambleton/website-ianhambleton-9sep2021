## Introduction
Research data handling refers to the activity of working with research data throughout the research process, from data collection, to data storage and backup, through to data sharing at the end of a research project.

Although handling research data can be challenging, managing your data effectively will help your research to be robust and replicable, can help you to anticipate potential problems that can occur during the research process, and will ensure that your research meets the requirements set out by research funders and publishers.

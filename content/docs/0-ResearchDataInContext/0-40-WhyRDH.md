## Introduction
There are a lot of great reasons why research data should be managed in an appropriate and timely manner. A lot of these are the same as the benefits of sharing your data. 
Some of the reasons are requirements (the sticks if you like), others are genuine benefits (definitely the carrots!). We like to think that the _carrots_ outweight the _sticks_.

## Some requirements for RDH / _sticks_:

<!-- FUNDER REQUIREMENTS -->
{{< expand "Funders' requirements" >}} 
<p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">
An increasing number of funding bodies are introducing formal expectations for how we manage the research data we generate directly from funded research. While policies vary, they generally include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">Submit a Data Management Plan (DMP) with a funding application,</p></li>
<li><p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">Look after data appropriately during the research, and</p></li>
<li><p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">Preserve and share the research data as widely as permitted at the end of the research project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">
Details will vary between funders of course, so we must <b>always check</b> our funderâ€™s website for current information and guidance on data management requirements. We will cover each of these broad areas in later sections of our guide.</p> <p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">We will introduce Data Management Plans <a href="../../1-planning/1-5-dmp/">in Chapter 1 - Planning</a>. We will describe aspects of looking after your data in Chapter 2 - Collecting Data and Chapter 3 - Processing Data. And we will explore how to share data in Chapter 6 - Sharing Data.</p>

<h4>Example: UKRI</h4>
<p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) encompasses 9 councils that collectively represent the major public research funder in the United Kingdom. UKRI has operated a principle of open-research since 2011. Their key principle defines the general move towards research openness:</p>

<blockquote>Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.</blockquote>

<p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">Practically, this translates into the need for explicit data management, data preservation and data sharing plans. Data collected using UKRI funding must be discoverable, accessible, and understandable - which tie closely to the 2016 concept of FAIR data (see more on FAIR data later in this chapter). UKRI recognises the possibility of legal and ethical restrictions on fully-open data, and also calls for recognition of data originators by third party users.</p>

<h4>Example: NIH</h4>
<p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the United States government body responsible for biomedical and public health research. In October 2020 it released its <it>Final Policy for Data Management and Sharing</it>. This Policy requires that:</p>

<blockquote>...all NIH funded research should submit Data Management and Sharing Plans and comply with pre-approved official NIH Institute plans.</blockquote> 

<p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">It emphasized the importance of good data management practices and established the expectation for maximizing the appropriate sharing of scientific data generated from NIH-funded or conducted research, with justified limitations or exceptions. The Policy applies to research funded or conducted by NIH that results in the generation of scientific data.</p>

<!-- JOURNAL REQUIREMENTS -->
{{< expand "Journal requirements" >}} 
<p style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:16px;color:#666666;">
Journal publishers increasingly require that researchers make all data linked to their manuscript results fully available, without restriction, at the time of publication. This usually means that the data are deposited in an accessible data centre or repository. This requirement applies to both commercially and publicly-funded research. There are a fast growing number of choices for where to store your data, and we explore how to choose a data repository in Chapter 6 - Sharing. Well known repositories that are free-to-use for individual researchers include <a href="https://www.zenodo.org" target="_blank">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://www.datadryad.org" target="_blank">Dryad</a>, <a href="https://www.figshare.com" target="_blank">FigShare</a>. You can explore many other repositories via the <a href="https://www.r3data.org" target="_blank">Registry of Research Data repositories</a>

**Summary**

In this national cross-sectional survey, we collected data for 1,234 participants aged at least 25 years on demographics, behavioural risk factors, medical history, place of treatment and costs incurred, blood pressure and anthropometry, and biochemical measures. Prevalence of each risk factor was estimated overall, for each sex separately, and stratified by three broad age-groups.

Additional data collections on randomly-selected participant subgroups collected information on objective physical activity and on dietary intake.

**The good and the bad news on risk factors**

- By international standards tobacco smoking is low in men
and very low in women
- Binge drinking is low in women but practised by
around a quarter of all men
- Much room for improvement in diet and physical activity
- Obesity is high, especially in women
- 19% of women have a BMI of 35 and above (6% of men)
- 62% of women have abdominal obesity (20% of men)
- The vast majority of Barbadian adults have
two or more risk factors; virtually no one is risk factor free

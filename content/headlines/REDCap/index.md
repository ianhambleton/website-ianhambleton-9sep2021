## What is REDCap?
- REDCap is an acronym for **R**esearch **E**lectronic **D**ata **Cap**ture, and is used by more than 4,500 instutitions in 140 countries. <br><br>
    
- REDCap was built by the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, with funding from the National Institutes of Health.<br><br>

- REDCap is a web-based system for data collection. Data entry staff or people taking an online survey enter data in a web browser, either locally or from remote locations.<br><br> 
  
- **_REDCap @ Cave Hill_** is operated jointly by the _Campus RDH Committee_ and _Campus IT Services_. All project data are stored centrally in a secure database, and backed-up daily.<br><br>

## REDCap @ UWI
We will be rolling out our Cave Hill REDCap installation during 2021. We have been piloting REDCap extensively during 2020, and already, 400 UWI staff and students from all 3 campuses have created and managed 181 research projects using REDCap.
